      Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe
      ˈfuðβol] (listen), meaning Royal Madrid Football Club), commonly referred
      to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in
      Madrid. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has
      traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific
      title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King
      Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real
      Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago
      Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European
      sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated
      the club throughout its history. Real Madrid is one of the most widely
      supported teams internationally.[6] The club was estimated to be worth
      $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football
      team.[7] In 2021, it was the second highest-earning football club in the
      world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.[8] Being one of the three
      founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top
      division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and
      Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing rivalries, most notably
      El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The
      club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European
      football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six
      overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was
      replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning twelve league titles
      in the span of 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano,
      Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is considered by some in
      the sport to be the greatest of all time.[9][10][11]Real Madrid is known
      for it's "Galácticos" policy, which involves signing the world's best
      players, such as Ronaldo, Zidane, and David Beckham, to create a superstar
      team.[12] On June 26 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record
      breaking £80 million (€94 million)[13] pounds, who went on becoming their
      most successful player of all time winning 16 titles with them and
      becoming their all time top goalscorer.[14] In domestic football, the club
      has won 68 trophies; a record 35 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 12
      Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a Copa de la Liga.[15] In
      European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21 trophies;[note 1] a
      record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two UEFA Cups, and a
      record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide competitions, they have
      achieved a record eight club world championships.[note 3] Considered as
      one of the most successful club of the 21st century.[21] Real Madrid was
      recognised as the FIFA Club of the Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35%
      of the vote,[22] and received the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May
      2004.[23] The club was also named Best European Club of the 20th Century
      by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010. Real Madrid is the only club to have win
      three consecutive titles in the Champions League twice, first in 1955-56,
      1956–57, 1957–58, and second in 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18. In May 2022,
      they won a record-extending fourteenth European Cup in 2021–22 UEFA
      Champions League, making it five titles in the last nine seasons. Real
      Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top five leagues to win
      100 trophies from all competitions.[24] As of March 2023, Real Madrid are
      ranked fifth behind Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea
      in the UEFA club rankings.[25]

        Early years (1902–1943)

        Julián Palacios, the first president of the club in 1900–1902
        Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates. They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as "New Foot-Ball Club".[26][27][28] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[4] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honor of a famous English team Corinthian F.C., which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[29][30]
        
        
        Madrid FC team in 1906
        Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[31] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[32]
        
        In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[33] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[34]
        
        On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honor of General Franco.[note 4][35] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[36] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a "clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain."[37] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, "Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins." Barcelona goalkeeper Lluis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, "They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up."[38]
        
        Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a "completely normal tackle". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled, "At which point, they got a bit demoralized," while Ángel Mur countered, "at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'."[39] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[40] According to football writer Sid Lowe, "There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims."[36] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said, "There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game

        Santiago Bernabéu and unprecedented success (1943–1978)

        Alfredo Di Stéfano led the club to win five consecutive European Cups (currently the Champions League)
        Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[42] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera," known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[43]
        
        
        Amancio Amaro, captain of the Yé-yé team of the 1960s
        In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Bedrignan and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[44] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[43] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honor.[45] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[46]
        
        The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[47] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name "Yé-yé" came from the "Yeah, yeah, yeah" chorus in The Beatles' song "She Loves You" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[48] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[49] and 1964.[47] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[50] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[51] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honor him during the tournament.[52] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president.
        
        Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won 1 Intercontinental Cup, 6 European Cups, 16 league titles, 6 Spanish Cups, 2 Latin Cups, and 1 Copa Eva Duarte.[53]

        In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the Liga title until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[54][55] Spanish sport journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre ("Vulture's Cohort"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel, and Miguel Pardeza; all five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[54][55] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[54][55] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club.
        
        In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[56] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro, and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[57]
        
        In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl González. Real added the budding young talents of Fernando Morientes, Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[58] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[59]
